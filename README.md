# Bank System - CQRS, Event Sourcing, Event-Driven, Minecraft Integration

This project is a banking system implemented using **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**, **Event Sourcing**, and an **Event-Driven architecture**, with full **integration into Minecraft**.

## Features
- Separation of **commands** (write operations) and **queries** (read operations)
- Immutable **event store** capturing all changes to aggregates
- Asynchronous **event-driven updates** to read models
- Scalable design allowing independent scaling of read and write sides
- Direct **integration with Minecraft**, enabling in-game banking operations and player interactions

## Architecture Overview
- **Commands** trigger actions in aggregates
- Aggregates generate **events** representing state changes
- **Event Store** persists events in an immutable log
- **Read models** are updated asynchronously from events for optimized queries
- **Event Bus** (Kafka) propagates events between services
- **Minecraft plugin layer** interacts with the system, translating in-game actions into commands and events

## Technology Stack
- Java, Spring Boot
- Postgres for event storage
- Kafka for event-driven communication
- Minecraft server integration
- Optional read model databases for optimized queries

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository
- Configure Postgres and Kafka connections
- Deploy the Minecraft plugin on a server
- Run the application and use REST endpoints or in-game commands for banking operations
